        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter
        logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
        information about you from your social media provider. The profile
        information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
        list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
        make public on such a social media platform.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2 mb-2">
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
        described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
        on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are
        not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
        third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
        privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
        personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
        their sites and apps.

      <p className="mt-2 mb-2">
        <em>In Short:</em> We keep your information for as long as necessary to
        fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise
        required by law.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-2 mb-2">
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us to keep your personal information for longer than twelve (12)
        months past the termination of the user&apos;s account.

      <p className="mt-2 mb-2">
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.

        <em>In Short:</em> We aim to protect your personal information through a
        system of organisational and technical security measures.

      <p className="mt-2 mb-2">
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and

        However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information,
        no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage
        technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
        guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
        parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect,
        access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best
        to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should

        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile

        DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to
        DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
        online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
        inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
